  (as stated at: http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/)

You may freely use and distribute this software as long as you retain the
author's name (myself and/or my students) with the software.
It would also be courteous for you to cite the toolbox and any related
publications in any papers that present results based on this software.
UM and the authors make all the usual disclaimers about liability etc.
If you make changes to any files, then please change the file name before
redistributing to avoid confusion (like the GNU software license). Better
yet, email me the changes and I'll consider incorporating them into the
toolbox.
